# Mancala DeepQ
[Mancala](Mancala) is the generic name for a family of ancient two-player turn-based strategy board games. It is played on a board with a series of holes arranged in rows, usually two or four. The objective is to capture all or some set of the opponent's pieces.

This repo contains a Mancala [gym](https://gym.openai.com) environment with a PyGame UI, as well as training code for a DQN-based agent. I made this to automate the  process of playing Mancala because I personally suck at the game.
